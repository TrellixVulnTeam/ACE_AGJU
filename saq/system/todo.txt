NOTES FROM REVIEWING EXISTING ENGINE
* handle detection points (probably in root.set_analysis) and analysis mode switches
* root.whitelisted <-- deal with whitelisting (automatic cancel in non-correlational mode)
* keep ace correlate in mind
* other stuff we do some an analysis becomes an alert
- move data (maybe no longer needed)
- insert into database (still needed)
* index at end of execution (in in the database as an alert)
* if there is no work left for a RootAnalysis and its left in a non-correlational mode
  then we probably need to delete it (or maybe not) - mark for expiration - something
* record analysis execution time - metrics
* logging
* add_observable (reintroduces into analysis)
* add_tag (reintroduces into analysis)
* analysis "stages" <-- I feel like this should be more about an event driven model
  PRE-ANALYSIS  - executes analysis modules that execute in "pre" mode <-- do we need this?
  ANALYSIS      - normal execution
  POST-ANALYSIS - work queue is empty for thei root analysis, switches to this stage
  ^ not sure that even make sense any more since you can now have analysis modules that take a really long time
* exclusions -- where do they live and where are they enforced?
  I think they need to be enforced by the system
* deal with some directives (exclude_all)
* limited analysis
* when to cancel analysis (disposition set by analyst)
* "priority" probably doesn't matter anymore

analysis modules should only receive work when ace expects a result back
however the analysis can still be None

Analysis needs to be updated to be able to record when an error occurs

an analysis module can be MANUAL
text = "Search QRadar for DNS entries."
help = "Searches QRadar for DNS entries for this blah blah blah."
^ don't happen until they are triggered by an analyst in the gui

operational_mode = automated
operational_mode = manual

user_menu = dns->zeek->Search zeek logs in splunk for this.

1.0 -> 2.0 TODO

# Analysis
- expand on the event listeners because I think we're going to use them now
- get rid of Analysis.instance (no longer needed)
                     .completed
                     .delayed
                     .alerted
                     .question (replaced by AnaysisModuleType.description)
                     .initialize_details
                     .is_suspect
                     .always_visible
                     .upgrade
- replace .json with to_dict()
- replace .json setter with static from_dict()
- how does storage_dir work now?
- how do we display Analysis now (is it any different?)
- should we supply an html template with the analysis module type?
- add a .critical property to both Analysis and Observable types
  anything that is critical shows up in the critical anaysis view

# Observables
- limited and excluded analysis needs to use amt.name
- type inheritance without classes
  main:sub1:sub2:sub3:...
  ipv4
  ipv4:src <-- still ipv4 but is also a src ipv4, everything that works with ipv4 also works with ipv4:src
  ipv4:dst
  email_address:smtp_from
  email_address:return_path
- switch to JSON for complex types
  ipv4_conversation = { 'src': '1.2.3.4', 'dst': '1.2.3.4' }
- big change how F_FILE works
  file is now complex { 'md5', 'sha1', 'sha256', name, path, owner, location, last_times, perms, etc... }
